# Fixing-ATF-controller-HMI
This guide will help you transfering the software from the HMI of C24 - 4 ATF system controller to a new HMI as Repligen no longer want to sell replace screens. All you need is a new HMI5070P from Maple System and a micro usb cable. 
The issue: The screen of the HMI start to get unreadable and it is difficult to interact with the controller
The solution: Order a 5070P screen from Maple Systems and download the software (ATF 2.5) onto the HMI using EZPlus, software can be downloaded for free from Maple Systems. The software is a unmodified version exacted from the old HMI using this guide: https://www.maplesystems.com/legacysolutions/converthmi5070thtoadvancedhmi.htm
